# Advanced Home Control Project

***Please Read Copyright Disclaimers***

This project is a continuation of the [***Smart Home Control Project***](https://github.com/SorenCaraan/SmartHomeControl).
This project now includes changed adapters and a customizable furnace. 
This Project was done during ***September to December 2022*** and was only pushed to GitHub
when the project was finished.

In this assignment, you will continue working on the Smart Home Controller challenge playing the
role of "Smart Builders", i.e., a bunch of developers who develop custom smart homes by putting
together various components. Here is what they want now

- ***Adapting an Old Sensor.*** You will need to use the ***adapter
pattern*** so that you bring it up to SSDCS standards.
- ***Adapting a Sensor with inverted control.*** Given a temperature sensor that follows the
***observer pattern***, ***combine*** the ***observer pattern*** with an ***adapter pattern*** to use this new sensor in your project.
- ***A Customizable Furnace.*** Apply the ***decorator pattern*** in order
to make sure that the furnace always initializes the appropriate components when it is
turned on.

Specifically, a consortium of smart home vendors, called "ITEC3030 Smart
Home Consortium‚Äù worked together to produce the Simple Smart Device Collaboration Standard
(SSDCS) in form of a set of Java Interfaces
