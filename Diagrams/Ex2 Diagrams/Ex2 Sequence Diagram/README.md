# Sequence Diagram

Criteria: A sequence diagram showing what happens when newTemperature(0) is called from Main. 

- This requires that o2.newTemperature(35) [Line 56 in Main.java] changes 35 to 2 for this. 
- Although ***unnecessary*** for my project, I ***re-coded*** Scenario 2 by making a new Main called ***MainNewTempZero.java***, other than that .java files are unchanged
- I reran Scenario 2 with ***MainNewTempZero.java***, if anyone wishes to recreate this project this is ***optional***
